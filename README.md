`liquid` is a pure Go implementation of [Shopify Liquid templates](https://shopify.github.io/liquid).
It was developed for use in the [Gojekyll](https://github.com/urbn8/gojekyll) port of the Jekyll static site generator.

## Installation

`go get gopkg.in/osteele/liquid.v1` # latest snapshot

`go get -u github.com/urbn8/liquid` # development version

## Usage

```go
engine := liquid.NewEngine()
template := `<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>`
bindings := map[string]interface{}{
    "page": map[string]string{
        "title": "Introduction",
    },
}
out, err := engine.ParseAndRenderString(template, bindings)
if err != nil { log.Fatalln(err) }
fmt.Println(out)
// Output: <h1>Introduction</h1>
```

See the [API documentation][godoc-url] for additional examples.

### Command-Line tool

`go install gopkg.in/osteele/liquid.v0/cmd/liquid` installs a command-line `liquid` executable.
This is intended to make it easier to create test cases for bug reports.

```bash
$ liquid --help
usage: liquid [FILE]
$ echo '{{ "Hello World" | downcase | split: " " | first | append: "!"}}' | liquid
hello!
```

## Documentation

### Status

These features of Shopify Liquid aren't implemented:

- Warn and lax [error modes](https://github.com/shopify/liquid#error-modes).
- Non-strict filters. An undefined filter is currently an error.
- Strict variables. An undefined variable is not an error.

### Drops

Drops have a different design from the Shopify (Ruby) implementation.
A Ruby drop sets `liquid_attributes` to a list of attributes that are exposed to Liquid.
A Go drop implements `ToLiquid() interface{}`, that returns a proxy object.
Conventionally, the proxy is a `map` or `struct` that defines the exposed properties.
See <http://godoc.org/github.com/urbn8/liquid#Drop> for additional information.

### Value Types

`Render` and friends take a `Bindings` parameter. This is a map of `string` to `interface{}`, that associates template variable names with Go values.

Any Go value can be used as a variable value. These values have special meaning:

- `false` and `nil`
  - These, and no other values, are recognized as false by `and`, `or`, `{% if %}`, `{% elsif %}`, and `{% case %}`.
- Integers
  - (Only) integers can be used as array indices: `array[1]`; `array[n]`, where `array` has an array value and `n` has an integer value.
  - (Only) integers can be used as the endpoints of a range: `{% for item in (1..5) %}`, `{% for item in (start..end) %}` where `start` and `end` have integer values.
- Integers and floats
  - Integers and floats are converted to their join type for comparison: `1 == 1.0` evaluates to `true`.  Similarly, `int8(1)`, `int16(1)`, `uint8(1)` etc. are all `==`.
  - [There is currently no special treatment of complex numbers.]
- Integers, floats, and strings
  - Integers, floats, and strings can be used in comparisons `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. Integers and floats can be usefully compared with each other. Strings can be usefully compared with each other, but not with other values. Any other comparison, e.g. `1 < "one"`, `1 > "one"`, is always false.
- Arrays (and slices)
  - An array can be indexed by integer value: `array[1]`; `array[n]` where `n` has an integer value.
  - Arrays have `first`, `last`, and `size` properties: `array.first == array[0]`, `array[array.size-1] == array.last` (where `array.size > 0`)
- Maps
  - A map can be indexed by a string: `hash["key"]`; `hash[s]` where `s` has a string value
  - A map can be accessed using property syntax `hash.key`
  - Maps have a special `size` property, that returns the size of the map.
- Drops
  - A value `value` of a type that implements the `Drop` interface acts as the value `value.ToLiquid()`. There is no guarantee about how many times `ToLiquid` will be called. [This is in contrast to Shopify Liquid, which both uses a different interface for drops, and makes stronger guarantees.]
- Structs
  - A public field of a struct can be accessed by its name: `value.FieldName`, `value["fieldName"]`.
    - A field tagged e.g. `liquid:‚Äùname‚Äù` is accessed as `value.name` instead.
    - If the value of the field is a function that takes no arguments and returns either one or two arguments, accessing it invokes the function, and the value of the property is its first return value.
    - If the second return value is non-nil, accessing the field panics instead.
  - A function defined on a struct can be accessed by function name e.g. `value.Func`, `value["Func"]`.
    - The same rules apply as to accessing a func-valued public field.
  - Note that despite being array- and map-like, structs do not have a special `value.size` property.
- `[]byte`
  - A value of type `[]byte` is rendered as the corresponding string, and presented as a string to filters that expect one. A `[]byte` is not (currently) equivalent to a `string` for all uses; for example, `a < b`, `a contains b`, `hash[b]` will not behave as expected where `a` or `b` is a `[]byte`.
- `MapSlice`
  - An instance of `yaml.MapSlice` acts as a map. It implements `m.key`, `m[key]`, and `m.size`.

Michael Hamrah's [Lexing with Ragel and Parsing with Yacc using Go](https://medium.com/@mhamrah/lexing-with-ragel-and-parsing-with-yacc-using-go-81e50475f88f) was essential to understanding `go yacc`.

The [original Liquid engine](https://shopify.github.io/liquid), of course, for the design and documentation of the Liquid template language. Many of the tag and filter test cases are taken directly from the Liquid documentation.
